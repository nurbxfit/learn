we need pair of wings to fly.

# never depend on the tools.

- sechub.medium.com
- learn about the technique
- learn about the system.

- subdomain: to manage diff entities, in one.
- subdomian enumeration.
- cert transparency: give us more info on vendor and other domain with cert issued by vendor.
- `crt.sh`
- `sublist3r`
- `securitytrails`
- not all subdomain we gethered is valid.

`host <domain>`
`ping <domain>`
`wappalyzer`
`whatweb`

```bash
for URL in $(cat list.txt)
do
    if host $URL > /dev/null; then
    echo $URL is UP;
    else
    echo $URL is DOWN
    fi
done
```
