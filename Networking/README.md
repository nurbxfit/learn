# About this Folder.

Basically things I learned about networking, such as linux network configuration,
topology design and implementation either using CISCO IOS devices or linux network router etc, it's been a while since I learn CCNA, so I just revisit it here. Most of the network topology examples, I run in network simulation or virtual machine for cases like setting up DHCP server or DNS server.
