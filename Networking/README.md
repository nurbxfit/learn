# About this Folder.

Basically things I learned about networking, such as linux network configuration,
topology design and implementation either using CISCO IOS devices or linux network router etc, it's been a while since I learn CCNA, so I just revisit it here. Most of the network topology examples, I run in network simulation or virtual machine for cases like setting up DHCP server or DNS server.

# Basic Networking.

## Routing.

- Routing consist of nodes devices called router.
- a Router connect one or more network together.
- Router are used to transfer data betweens network, it acts as the main gateways
- Routers communicates with each other in order to determines the best route/path to transfer data.
- after the best path are determined, they use that path to send data.
- the path are stored in a Routing table.

### Router.

- router is just another devices like our computer but specialize to handle routing.
- like any other devices, it has its own CPU, memory and operating system, and I/O ports.
- there are 2 common Interfaces that you need to know

  - LAN Interface
    - LAN (Local Area Network).
    - it's usually an Ethernet that connect to devices in our private network.
  - WAN Interface
    - WAN (Wide Are Network).
    - use to connect to another router or Wide networks own by the ISP (internet Service Provider).
